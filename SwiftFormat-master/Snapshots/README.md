The files in this directory constitute a regression test suite, used to check for unintended changes to SwiftFormat's behavior.

Projects in this directory include only the swift files and documentation/licence information. There are missing their project files and other resources, and in most cases will not compile. If you are interested in using these libraries, you will find them on Github.

If you would like to add your own projects to this test suit, please [open a pull request](https://nicklockwood/SwiftFormat). Be sure to remove all non-swift files apart from documentation and SwiftFormat configuration.
